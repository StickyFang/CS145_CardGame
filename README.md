# CS145_CardGame
Simple Black Jack code
Get as close to 21 as you can without going over!

This code uses a few diffrent classes, one to make the deck, one to create each individual card, and one to keep track of cards in current hand
Dealer is programmed to hit no matter what if user hand is higher, so play that to your advantage :)

More than anything, this project was a learning exercise for .class
If I can get around to it, I will add betting and doubling down.

Good-luck! :)
